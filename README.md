# Azure Sphere Samples
This repository contains samples for the [Azure Sphere platform](https://www.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/).

## Using the samples
See the [Azure Sphere Getting Started](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-sphere/get-started/) page for details on getting an [Azure Sphere Development kit](https://aka.ms/AzureSphereHardware) and setting up your PC for development. You should complete the Azure Sphere [Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/overview) and [Quickstarts](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/quickstarts/qs-overview) to validate that your environment is configured properly before using the samples here. 

Clone this entire repository locally. The repository includes the [hardware definition files](./Hardware/) that are required to run the samples on a range of Azure Sphere hardware.

Each folder within the samples subdirectory contains a README.md file that describes the samples therein. Follow the instructions for each individual sample to build and deploy it to your Azure Sphere hardware to learn about the features that the sample demonstrates.
